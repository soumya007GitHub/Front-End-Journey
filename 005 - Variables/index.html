    <h2>Var</h2>
    <p>Variables declared with var are function-scoped if declared inside a function, meaning they are accessible anywhere within that function. If declared outside any function, they become globally scoped and are accessible throughout the entire program.</p>
    <h2>let</h2>
    <p>let keyword is block scope means can be accessed within the block.</p>
    <h2>const</h2>
    <p>the value of the const variable can't be changed later on.</p>

    <h2>What is Hoisting?</h2>

    <p>Var will throw undefined value and let will throw error.</p>
