# üìú History of JavaScript & Its Evolution

## 1. Birth of JavaScript
- In **1995**, **Netscape** wanted a lightweight programming language for web browsers.
- Netscape‚Äôs founder **Marc Andreessen** approached **Brendan Eich**, who created the first version of the language in **just 10 days**.
- Initially, it was called **Mocha**, later renamed to **LiveScript**, and finally to **JavaScript** *(mainly for marketing purposes to ride on Java's popularity at that time)*.

---

## 2. Microsoft & JScript
- Around the same time, **Microsoft** developed **JScript** for its **Internet Explorer** browser.
- Due to differences between **JavaScript** (Netscape) and **JScript** (Microsoft), developers faced **compatibility issues**.

---

## 3. ECMA Standardization
- To solve these problems, **Netscape** submitted JavaScript to **ECMA International** *(European Computer Manufacturers Association)*.
- In **1997**, **ECMA** standardized the language and called it **ECMAScript**.
- **JavaScript** is an **implementation** of **ECMAScript**.

# ‚ö° JavaScript Execution

## 4. JavaScript Engines
Every browser uses a **JavaScript engine** to execute JS code:

- **V8 Engine** ‚Üí Google Chrome *(extremely fast)*  
- **SpiderMonkey** ‚Üí Mozilla Firefox  
- **JavaScriptCore** ‚Üí Safari  
- **Chakra** ‚Üí Older Microsoft Edge  

---

## 5. Node.js
- **Node.js** uses the **V8 engine** **outside of the browser**, enabling developers to **run JavaScript on servers**.

# üñ•Ô∏è Interpreted vs Compiled Languages

## 6. Traditional Difference
- **Interpreted Languages** ‚Üí Execute **line by line**, making them **slower** but **easier to debug**.
- **Compiled Languages** ‚Üí Compile the entire code into **machine code** **before execution**, making them **faster**.

---

## 7. JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation)
Modern JS engines like **V8** use **JIT compilation**, combining the benefits of both **interpreted** and **compiled** approaches:

- JS code is **parsed and interpreted first** for quick execution.
- Frequently used parts of the code are **compiled into machine code** at runtime, making **JavaScript much faster**.

---

## 8. WorldWideWeb ‚Äì First Browser üåê
- The **first web browser**, called **WorldWideWeb**, was created by **Tim Berners-Lee** in **1990**.
- It laid the foundation for modern browsers like **Netscape**, **Internet Explorer**, **Chrome**, and **Firefox**.

---

## üìå Summary
- **Mocha ‚Üí LiveScript ‚Üí JavaScript ‚Üí ECMAScript**
- Standardized by **ECMA** to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- **V8 engine** revolutionized JS performance.
- **Node.js** brought JavaScript to the **server-side**.
- **JIT compilation** made JavaScript **as fast as compiled languages**.
